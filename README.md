Cold Mail Generator is a smart AI-based tool that helps generate personalized cold emails by matching job descriptions with your company's past projects. Built using Python, Streamlit, Langchain, ChromaDB, and Google Gemini, this project streamlines outreach by combining portfolio insights with powerful language models.

The app can scrape job posts from URLs, extract key skills, match them with relevant portfolio projects stored in a vector database, and then generate tailored cold emails using LLMs. It also evaluates the generated emails for quality using RAGAS metricsâ€”all within a smooth and interactive Streamlit interface.
